# Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I use every day: 
- Ctrl-C (copy)
- Ctrl-V (paste)
- Ctrl-X (cut)

# Shortcuts I would like to start using
- Windows key + up key <em>(maximize window)</em>
- Win-D <em>(show desktop)</em> <strong>I didn't know I could do this!</strong>
- Cntrl-Z (Undo) Something that would have been very helpful last week!
