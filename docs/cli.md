<h1>Week 6 Lab</h1>
Currently in this course I'm learning about CLI (command line interface.)

```

ls- This command lets you see all the files and folders that are in the same directory that you're in.

cat- when you find a file you want to open you have to add the cat (file name) to open it.

cd- change directory

ls -alps- to see file specifics.
```
